# Asteroids
Asteroids using ES6 class syntax.

An ES6 take on the classic browser game Asteroids. Compiled with Babel for backwards compatibility, I implement new ES6 class syntax alongside HTML5 and Canvas to render a colored background complete with asteroid, bullet, and spaceship images. Slug it out versus 10 asteroids and unlimited lives. Both asteroids and the ship wrap to the boundaries of the 1000x600 canvas. Complete with sounds for game music, collisions, thrusters, and firing bullets. Victory sound is played when all asteroids are cleared. Ability to pause/resume music and start/restart the game with Enter. I utilize Webpack to conveniently output the Asteroids game assets into a production ready bundle.
